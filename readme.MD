## Generate Express project Directory
Written over the Mighty Python. I like to  call Python like that :)
This app creates NodeJs Express project directories with basic files and automatically
installs all the dependencies specified when creating directory. It will also import all
of them to the project main file.

You can add more dependencies after a space.
